# Swytch.sh 
A real-time, collaborative multiplayer drawing and guessing game.

swytch.sh is a unique twist on the classic "Pictionary" style game. Unlike traditional games where one person draws the entire word, swytch forces two players to collaborate on a single drawing. The catch? The pen "swytches" between them every 20 seconds. It’s a test of intuition, teamwork, and artistic speed.

## 🎮 How to Play
1.  **Join the Lobby:** Enter your name, pick an avatar, and share your Room ID with friends.
2.  **The Roles:** 
    * **Drawer 1 (The Foundation):** You see the secret word immediately. You have 20 seconds to start the sketch before the pen is taken away.
    * **Drawer 2 (The Finisher):** You start with only a hint (dashes and a few letters). You must pick up exactly where Drawer 1 left off. The secret word is revealed to you only after 60 seconds.
    * **Guessers:** Everyone else watches the live "swytch" and types their guesses in the chat.
3.  **The Swytch:** The drawing control toggles between the two artists every 20 seconds until time runs out.
4.  **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on how quickly the word is guessed. Artists earn points when their peers are successful.
