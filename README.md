# Swytch.sh 
A real-time, collaborative multiplayer drawing and guessing game.

swytch.sh is a unique twist on the classic "Pictionary" style game. Unlike traditional games where one person draws the entire word, in swytch, two players collaborate on a single drawing while rest of the players guess. The catch? The pen "swytches" between them every 20 seconds. It’s a test of intuition, teamwork, and artistic speed.

## 🎮 How to Play
1.  **Join the Lobby:** Enter your name, pick an avatar, and share your Room ID with friends.
2.  **The Roles:** 
    * **Drawer 1 (The Foundation):** You see the secret word immediately. You have 20 seconds to start the sketch before the pen is taken away.
    * **Drawer 2 (The Finisher):** You start with only a hint (dashes and a few letters). You must pick up exactly where Drawer 1 left off. The secret word is revealed to you only after 60 seconds.
    * **Guessers:** Everyone else watches the live "swytch" and types their guesses in the chat.
3.  **The Swytch:** The drawing control toggles between the two artists every 20 seconds until time runs out.
4.  **Scoring:** Points are awarded based on how quickly the word is guessed. Artists earn points when their peers are successful.
5. In the beginning of every round in the game, two new drawers are chosen at random.
